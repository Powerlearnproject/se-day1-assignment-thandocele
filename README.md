#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software is a program or set of programs containing instructions that provide the desired functionality. Engineering is the process of designing and building something that serves a particular purpose and finds a cost-effective solution to problems.
Improved Quality: By following established software engineering principles and techniques, the software can be developed with fewer bugs and higher reliability.
Increased Productivity: Using modern tools and methodologies can streamline the development process, allowing developers to be more productive and complete projects faster.
Better Maintainability: Software that is designed and developed using sound software engineering practices is easier to maintain and update over time.
Reduced Costs: By identifying and addressing potential problems early in the development process, software engineering can help to reduce the cost of fixing bugs and adding new features later on.
Increased Customer Satisfaction: By involving customers in the development process and developing software that meets their needs, software engineering can help to increase customer satisfaction.
Better Team Collaboration: By using Agile methodologies and continuous integration, software engineering allows for better collaboration among development teams.
Better Scalability: By designing software with scalability in mind, software engineering can help to ensure that software can handle an increasing number of users and transactions.
Better Security: By following the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and performing security testing, software engineering can help to prevent security breaches and protect sensitive data.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Pioneering Days (1940s-1950s)

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Software development life cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software. SDLC, or software development life cycle, is a methodology that defines the entire procedure of software development step-by-step. The goal of the SDLC life cycle model is to deliver high-quality, maintainable software that meets the userâ€™s requirements. SDLC in software engineering models outlines the plan for each stage so that each stage of the software development model can perform its task efficiently to deliver the software at a low cost within a given time frame that meets users requirements. In this article we will see Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in detail.
Stage-1: Planning and Requirement Analysis
Planning is a crucial step in everything, just as in software development. In this same stage, requirement analysis is also performed by the developers of the organization. This is attained from customer inputs, and sales department/market surveys. 
Stage-2: Defining Requirements
In this stage, all the requirements for the target software are specified. These requirements get approval from customers, market analysts, and stakeholders. 
This is fulfilled by utilizing SRS (Software Requirement Specification). This is a sort of document that specifies all those things that need to be defined and created during the entire project cycle. 
Stage-3: Designing Architecture
SRS is a reference for software designers to come up with the best architecture for the software. Hence, with the requirements defined in SRS, multiple designs for the product architecture are present in the Design Document Specification (DDS). 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is an approach to project management and software development that follows a linear sequence of events. In Waterfall, each phase of the project is gated. Teams cannot advance from one phase of the SDLC to the next until the current phase is complete. Each phase has clearly defined completion criteria. Criteria for the project are generated in the first stage of Waterfall -- the requirements stage -- and codified in documentation. The requirements set forth in the beginning ideally do not change during the course of a development project in this model.
Agile is an approach to project management, specifically software development projects, that prioritizes collaboration, continuous delivery and customer feedback. Agile breaks work into iterative steps, which are smaller tasks that can be completed quickly. These iterations are done during sprints. Agile teams complete one sprint before moving onto the next one. Requirements can change at any time in the project based on changing business needs or customer feedback. Future sprints are based on the outcomes of previous sprints.
Agile software development emphasizes iterative work. This distinguishes Agile from Waterfall development, which entails grouped development, where all the work must reach the same point of completion before moving onto the next phase of the SDLC.
With an approach based on small changes, complex software development processes are trackable and manageable for all stakeholders. If development teams try to change too much code at once -- if, for example, they try to build a number of new features at the same time -- they risk encountering unanticipated problems that delay the project. These delays can create challenges for other stakeholders -- for example, a business department that expects a new feature to be available by the date of a customer project kickoff.
Agile limits the scope of work and focuses on adapting to changing circumstances. These traits make Agile beneficial for complex projects in which unanticipated problems can arise and require development teams to pivot in response.
The tendency for Waterfall projects to go over anticipated deadlines and scope means that Waterfall is rarely used today. In general, most teams prefer Agile.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Set the QA process objectives to ensure that the result leads to the fulfillment of all product requirements
Plan testing activities according to the objectives and create a strategy based on schedule and other project specifics
Conduct testing activities, whether manual or automated QA testing, during appropriate development stages to eliminate bugs and flaws
Document the testing results and analyze the errors to identify their root cause
Work with developers, testers, and other stakeholders to troubleshoot testing failures and bugs
Communicate with project managers and other stakeholders about QA systems,  activities, and progress
Help monitor performance and uncover system vulnerabilities through tools and bug tracking systems

Developing applications, programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
Maintaining and updating software to keep it functional.
Collaborating with other team members to ensure best practices when developing software.
Report to the project manager about the progress of the software development.  

Project Manager 
In software development, the roles of the project manager may include helping the team to design, execute, monitor and finish their work so that the clients will receive higher-quality software products. 
Responsibilities 
Discuss the project and its requirements with clients and software developers.
Assemble and lead the software development team.
Create the blueprint for the project, including the scope, allocating resources, setting deadlines and laying out communication strategies.
Supervising each stage of the software development project.
Set the budget and ensure the project adheres to it as closely as possible.
Tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestones, deliverables and change requests.
Deliver the completed software to the client and regularly check its performance. 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE helps in combining common activities of writing software into a single application such as editing source code, building executables, and debugging. IDE is basically an Environment or Combination of tools like a text editor, debugger, and Compiler. Throughout the process of writing, creating, and testing software, developers employ a variety of tools. Text editors, code libraries, bug tracking software, compilers, and test platforms are among the most common development tools. It combines several of these development-related technologies into a single framework. It is also helpful for new developers who may use an IDE to learn about a teamâ€™s standard tools and practices. The main aim is to make software development easier while also detecting and reducing code errors and typos.
Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done in the code. 
Why Version Control system is so Important?
As we know that a software product is developed in collaboration by a group of developers they might be located at different locations and each one of them contributes to some specific kind of functionality/features. So in order to contribute to the product, they made modifications to the source code(either by adding or removing). A version control system is a kind of software that helps the developer team to efficiently communicate and manage(track) all the changes that have been made to the source code along with the information like who made and what changes have been made. A separate branch is created for every contributor who made the changes and the changes arenâ€™t merged into the original source code unless all are analyzed as soon as the changes are green signaled they merged to the main source code. It not only keeps source code organized but also improves productivity by making the development process smooth.
Basically Version control system keeps track on changes made on a particular software and take a snapshot of every modification. Letâ€™s suppose if a team of developer add some new functionalities in an application and the updated version is not working properly so as the version control system keeps track of our work so with the help of version control system we can omit the new changes and continue with the previous version.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
. Lack of Workflow Visibility
You canâ€™t fully control the external events that impact your software development. But you can be in complete control of the internal factors and prepare your team to be highly resilient and respond to all sorts of challenges. 
A lot of development teams suffer because of a vague understanding of the engineering processes within their organization. Many donâ€™t have clarity about the status of the projects, the activities and challenges of the individuals, and whatnot. 
All these stem from ineffective communication, lack of effective team collaboration, and broken SDLC processes. The domino effect of this is detrimental to your engineering efficiency, and the overall success of the organization. 
Lack of visibility is a critical software engineering challenge. Fail to acknowledge the visibility issue or brush it aside, and in no time your team may get beset by a plethora of business and software engineering challenges that sprout due to lack of visibility:
Misalignment between business goals & tech effort
Technical debt
Delayed projects & increased costs
Inefficient resource allocation & utilization
Software performance challenges
Siloed communication
Broken SDLC Processes
Your software development processes can be broken at multiple levels. It could be any of the following-

Poor requirement gathering
Scope creep
Code smells
Improper code reviews
Unhelpful documentation
Inefficient CI/CD pipelines
Inadequate testing or test coverage
Ineffective observability & monitoring
Lack of compliance & regulatory alignment 
Poor crisis response operating procedures, etcetera.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Software testing can be performed at different levels of the software development process. Performing testing activities at multiple levels help in the early identification of bugs and better quality of software product. In this tutorial, we will be studying the different levels of testing namely â€“ Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, and Acceptance Testing.
Unit Testing is the first level of testing usually performed by the developers.
In unit testing, a module or component is tested in isolation.
As the testing is limited to a particular module or component, exhaustive testing is possible.
Advantage â€“ Error can be detected at an early stage saving time and money to fix it.
Limitation â€“ Integration issues are not detected in this stage, modules may work perfectly on isolation but can have issues in interfacing between the modules.
Integration testing is the second level of testing in which we test a group of related modules.
It aims at finding interfacing issues b/w the modules i.e. if the individual units can be integrated into a sub-system correctly.
It is of four types â€“ Big-bang, top-down, bottom-up, and Hybrid.
In big bang integration, all the modules are first required to be completed and then integrated. After integration, testing is carried out on the integrated unit as a whole.
System Testing is the third level of testing.
It is the level of testing where the complete integrated application is tested as a whole.
It aims at determining if the application conforms to its business requirements.
System testing is carried out in an environment that is very similar to the production environment.
System Testing is the third level of testing.
It is the level of testing where the complete integrated application is tested as a whole.
It aims at determining if the application conforms to its business requirements.
System testing is carried out in an environment that is very similar to the production environment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is one of the most critical techniques in Artificial intelligence (AI), especially while using large language models (LLMs) and generative AI systems. This process involves crafting and refining a set of inputs or instructions that can be provided to AI models in order to increase their capability of generating responses that are correct and relevant.
Many techniques are utilized, such as chain-of-thought prompting, zero-shot and few-shot prompting, prompt chaining, self-consistency prompting, and meta prompting. Effective prompt engineering can have a strong impact on the quality of AI-generated content and its results would be more likely to be correct and relevant. Mastering prompt engineering would become increasingly critical with the continued advancement of AI technology, helping developers, researcher and businesses make the most effective use of AI.
Best Practices for Prompt Engineering
When it comes to maximizing the efficiency of AI models, especially Large Language Models, effective prompt engineering is very vital. Here are some key best practices to know:
1. Be Clear and Specific
Clarify your request so that nothing is ambiguous in your request. The more the precision of a request, the better the model can understand that request and accomplish it.
Avoid difficult Language: Explain in simple terms what artificial intelligence is, what it's being applied to most for now, and what it is likely to do in the near future.
Specify the Format: Summarize this article in 100 words, using key takeaways and applications to frame the summary.
2. Specify Response Format
Clarify how you want the response to be returned. You might ask for points in a bullet format, enumerate the points with numbers or require a formatted essay.
Use Structured Format: List 5 AI applications with brief descriptions in bullet points.
Define the Tone and Complexity: Explain blockchain in layman's terms so that even a non-technical could understand what it is.
3. Context May Improve Accuracy
This includes background information or context that would further help the model generate more accurate and relevant responses.
Include Relevant Parameters: List the top programming languages in web development for 2025 with respect to performance and ease of learning.
Use Role-Based Prompt: I am a financial analyst. As a financial analyst, give investment advice for a beginner who plans to invest his money in the stock market with minimal risk.
3. Role-Based Prompts
Provide a task for the model to influence how it would look at a question and then answer it. Using role-based prompts makes AI responses more context-aware, specialized, and targeted. Here, you are assigning a role to the AI; this role sends a signal to the AI to design answers from a particular perspective or expertise level.
Use Role Based Scenario: You are a customer service manager. How would you deal with an angry customer because of a late order?
Improve Technical Explanation: As a lecturer in the university, describe to you undergrads the basic quantum computing explanation as simple as it could get.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
ssues with the Poorly-Written Prompt
1- Lack of Specificity:

The prompt doesnâ€™t specify which aspect of technology to focus on, leaving the AI to guess the userâ€™s intent.
2- Ambiguity: Without context or additional information, the AI may struggle to understand the purpose of the response.
3- Open-Ended: The prompt is too broad, leading to potential responses that are too general and not informative.

How to Improve the Prompt
Improving a prompt involves providing clear and concise instructions that guide the AI toward the desired outcome. Letâ€™s refine the above prompt to make it more effective.

Example of an Improved Prompt
"Write a 500-word article about the impact of artificial intelligence on the healthcare industry, focusing on recent advancements in diagnostic tools."

Key Improvements
1- Specificity: The improved prompt specifies the subject matter (artificial intelligence in healthcare) and the particular aspect to focus on (recent advancements in diagnostic tools). This narrows the scope, guiding the AI to provide relevant information.

2- Clear Objective: The prompt sets a clear objective by asking for a 500-word article. This helps the AI understand the expected length and format of the response.

3- Context and Focus: By mentioning "recent advancements," the prompt provides context and directs the AI to discuss current developments, ensuring the response is timely and informative.
